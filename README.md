# song-merger

## How to run
```bash
go run main.go
```

The command above starts a server listening to `127.0.0.1:8000`, to which you can send requests to all the routes.

### Current Routes

```json
[

        "name": "ride",
        "artist": "twenty-one-pilots",
        "musicalTone": 4
    },
    {
        "name": "dust-in-the-wind",
        "artist": "Kansas",
        "musicalTone": 3
    }
]
```
